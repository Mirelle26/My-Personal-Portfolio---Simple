    <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
    <p>I am a second-year student from section 2B diving deeper into the world of IT. It's been quite a ride
         so far, from getting the hang of coding to understanding networks and systems. Each day brings new challenges and discoveries,
          but I'm loving every minute of it.</p>
